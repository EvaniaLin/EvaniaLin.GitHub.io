In the age-old battle between cats lovers and dog lovers, there may never be a clear winner. I love both pets and they are both the companions of human being. But in my opinion, cats are better than dogs in some ways.

Even though both cats and dogs can provide social benefits to humans, cats are more of a friend to human. Unlike dogs, who obey to human in order to be feed, cats never want food from humans, they choose to stay with human because they regard the owner as their friend. In company with cats, human can learn to capture the emotion of cats and listen to cats when they are not happy, which is the same way human bond with each other. So, more interactions with cats will help us how to handle the relationship and improve our emotional intelligence.
