description: Some people believe that developments in the field of artificial intelligence will have a positive impact on our lives in the near future. Others, by contrast, are worried that we are not prepared for a world in which computers are more intelligent than humans. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.

People are either excited and worried about the future impact of artificial intelligence. Personally, I can understand both excitement and concern; I am both fascinated by development in AI and apprehensive of its future impact.

On the one hand, the increasing intelligence of technology can bring human many benefits. Machines are clearly doing many jobs better than humans do, especially those which require accuracy or calculations based on a large amount of data. The robots have introduced in hospitals and doing jobs in surgical procedures with greater precision. Self-driving cars can improve safety by reducing human errors. These development of technology can improve our quality of life.

On the other hand, the technology of artificial intelligence can harm us in many ways. In shorter term, with robots can do many jobs better than human, there will be a rise in unemployment. For example, self driving cars will make redundancies in driving jobs, such as lorry drivers, taxi drivers and bus drivers. In the medium term, if the production of artificial intelligence takes jobs away, human will become deskilled and lose their sense of purpose. In the longer term, if those smart things become so intelligence that they make decisions without setting and are against human, human may be harmed by them.

In conclusion, while artificial intelligence improve our lives, the potential risks should not be ignored.
